## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder. 

BRAINSTORM:

This website presents an architectural overview and detailed design of the Krypton network, the first decentralized search engine built on Web3 principles. Krypton leverages blockchain technology, token-driven incentives, and privacy-focused features to revolutionize internet search. The proposed solution incorporates distributed storage, decentralized web crawling and indexing, a consensus mechanism, open-source search algorithms, and a privacy-focused search experience. Krypton introduces the novel concept of Proof of Learning, a machine learning protocol embedded in the search engine to facilitate the discovery of decentralized platforms and enable direct peer-to-peer networking. The system also employs decentralized cloud technologies (validators in the PoS blockchain) to promote enhanced decentralization and encryption, paving the way for a more secure and equitable internet.
