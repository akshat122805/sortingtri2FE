## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder. 

BRAINSTORM:

This website presents an architectural overview and detailed design of the Krypton network, the first decentralized search engine built on Web3 principles. Krypton leverages blockchain technology, token-driven incentives, and privacy-focused features to revolutionize internet search. The proposed solution incorporates distributed storage, decentralized web crawling and indexing, a consensus mechanism, open-source search algorithms, and a privacy-focused search experience. Krypton introduces the novel concept of Proof of Learning, a machine learning protocol embedded in the search engine to facilitate the discovery of decentralized platforms and enable direct peer-to-peer networking. The system also employs decentralized cloud technologies (validators in the PoS blockchain) to promote enhanced decentralization and encryption, paving the way for a more secure and equitable internet.

The prevailing consensus in today's internet landscape is that data-driven platforms amass enormous profits and influence within the technology and retail sectors. The centralized nature of the internet will inevitably be challenged as decentralized networks with more advanced capabilities emerge. Web3 has long been envisioned as the successor to Web2 [4], offering greater privacy, security, and peer-to-peer interactions. Krypton is set to become one of the pioneering applications for Web3, serving as a platform and host akin to Google's role in the Web2 era. This innovative search engine will employ algorithms similar to those used by Google, while integrating the cutting-edge technology of blockchain to enhance its capabilities.

By integrating Filecoin into Krypton's storage system, Krypton can benefit from a competitive storage marketplace, resulting in more efficient and cost-effective storage solutions. Additionally, Filecoin's native token (FIL) can be used to incentivize users to contribute their spare storage resources to the network, further strengthening the decentralized nature of Krypton's search engine.
Filecoin's content-addressed storage system ensures that data is securely and redundantly stored across multiple nodes in the network. As users contribute their storage resources, the network becomes more resilient to potential failures or censorship attempts. This approach aligns with Krypton's core principles of privacy, decentralization, and open access to information.
